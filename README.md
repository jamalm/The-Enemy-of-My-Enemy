# The-Enemy-of-My-Enemy
A video game created to display different AI steering behaviours in action

There are 3 types of creatures, 

Guardians, Predators and Prey

The Guardians are the largest, slow moving and protectors of the prey from the predators, they only hunt when they are hungry and provide a shield of protection for the prey

The Predators are smaller but craftier, they are constantly battling their fear over their hunger, causing them to perform more dangerous attacks on the prey, risking their life for food

The prey are weak but plentiful, they move in herds around the Guardians, seeking shelter and a leader, when this leader becomes incapacitated, the prey scatter, disorganised and get hunted down very easily unless they find a new guardian. 

The player is a prey creature, your objective is to outlive the predators, to protect your guardian by feeding them and providing energy to keep them alive, keeping your guardian alive keeps you alive! 

The AI is controlled using a mixture of Steering behaviours that are triggered using a Finite State Machine algorithm.
